# Weather-Monitoring-System

A growing demand for integrated security and safety systems leads to an increase in the initiatives taken for smart community projects.
The system proposed in this project is an advanced solution for monitoring the weather conditions at a particular place and make the information visible anywhere in the world. 
The technology behind this is Internet of things (IoT), which is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting the things to the internet and to connect the entire world of things in a network.
Here things might be whatever like electronic gadgets, sensors and automotive electronic equipment. The system deals with monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, pressure and light intensity with sensors and sends the information to the thing speak and then plot the sensor data as graphical statistics.
For this purpose, three sensors are used namely temperature and humidity sensor , rain sensors, pressure sensor and ldr have been used, the data updated from the implemented system can be accessible in the internet from anywhere in the world. Weather monitoring is a systematic method that gives us detailed information about the weather of our surrounding environment.
